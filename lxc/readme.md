first we need an image to work with.

open a shell on your pve node (if clustered, the one that hosts your lxc containers), this can be done through shell access in the webinterface also.

` pveam update `

` pveam available `

` pveam download local ubuntu-21.04-standard_21.04-1_amd64.tar.gz `

` pveam list local `
